# API_RESTful (Back-end)

This program performs processes such as create, read, update and delete (CRUD) in relation to user and student profiles. When registering a user in the system,
it is possible to log in with that user and, consequently, receive a Jason Web Token as a form of identification. 
This identification serves to allow the user to access other API functionalities related to the administration of each student's profile or the creation of new users.
It is also possible to save photos for students registered in the system, in addition to the program having personalized and standardized error responses in case of invalid data entries.
